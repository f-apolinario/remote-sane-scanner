Saned Scanner lacks of a proper way to scan files from a remote scanner...

This project may be the solution we have all been waiting for!

-For now the client connects to the server by web browser:
http://ip:port , where this ip and port is specified in the server/config.json
-Specify the name of the file they want the output to send and submit
-server starts scanning file
-When finished server alerts client.
